## If you want to get started with the Julia language, check out this list of Courses, Cooks, And even some packages to get you started.

### Quicky

**Julia is C+Python, in other words, it is simple and fast, Julia is 1-index based.**

#### Resources to Learn Julia

* [I highly suggest reading the docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), and refer to it often.

* [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/courses). Definitely My Favourite choice.

* [Julia Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9IuUwwE2xdjQUT_LMLONoA)

* [My quick Julia crash course](https://leapollo.hashnode.dev/julia-crash-course)

And just picking one of these and going through it will help you pick up and get used to the language, my personal choice would be the `Julia Academy` Linked above.

Once you know the language it's time to write some code and play with cool packages.
